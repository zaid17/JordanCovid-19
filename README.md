# JordanCovid-19
Jordan Covid-19 is a small project to represent covid-19 statistics in jordan and some other countries.

I used :
1-an api to keep track of cases day by day.
2-charting library to respresent the cases in many forms.

The main idea of this project is to help the people to keep track of the cases and to see the changes by time.
